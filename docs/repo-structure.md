# Repository Structure

This repo uses the lean instrument-folder layout documented in [instrument-maker/docs/instrument-repo-folder-template.md](../../instrument-maker/docs/instrument-repo-folder-template.md). The goal is to keep the GitHub root short enough that the README preview is visible immediately.

```text
tongue-drum/
├── README.md                   # first-reader overview
├── LICENSE

├── tools/                      # repo-specific generators or analysis scripts
└── .gitignore
```

The full move history for this layout is tracked in [`reorg-manifest.json`](reorg-manifest.json).
